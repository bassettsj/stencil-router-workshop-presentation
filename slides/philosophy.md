## Philosophy

Philosophy of React Router v4

*Static vs Dynamic Routing*

---

### Express Style Static

```js
// Express Style routing:
app.get("/", handleIndex);
app.get("/invoices", handleInvoices);
app.get("/invoices/:id", handleInvoice);
app.get("/invoices/:id/edit", handleInvoiceEdit);
```

---

### Dynamic

> "When we say dynamic routing, we mean routing that takes place as your app is rendering,"

---

### Nested Routes

```js
const App = () => (
  <BrowserRouter>
    {/* here's a div */}
    <div>
      {/* here's a Route */}
      <Route path="/tacos" component={Tacos} />
    </div>
  </BrowserRouter>
);

// when the url matches `/tacos` this component renders
const Tacos = ({ match }) => (
  // here's a nested div
  <div>
    {/* here's a nested Route,
        match.url helps us make a relative path */}
    <Route path={match.url + "/carnitas"} component={Carnitas} />
  </div>
);
```

### Responsive Routes
